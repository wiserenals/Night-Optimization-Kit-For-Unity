### ðŸ§ª NightPath Pathfinding System: <br>

**NightPath** is a fully customizable pathfinding package that allows you to work with different agent models, pathfinding algorithms, and post-processors. You can also create your own agent models, algorithms, and post-processors to integrate seamlessly with NightPath. By default, NightPath includes two pathfinding algorithms: **QGIS** and **Flow Vector**. Algorithms like *A**, *Dijkstra*, or any other custom solutions can be implemented as well.

Quadrant Growth and Intersection Search (QGIS) is a pathfinding algorithm designed to identify the nodes an agent can access or "see" within its environment. The algorithm starts from a central node and expands outward in four quadrants (up, down, left, right), as well as diagonally, forming a growing square. The expansion continues as long as neighboring nodes meet a minimum weight threshold, ensuring that only valid paths are considered. By combining square-based growth with diagonal searches, QGIS identifies all reachable nodes. This makes it particularly effective for agents that need to dynamically detect accessible areas and optimize their movement in complex environments.
