&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Easily call frame-based methods less to improve performance!<br>
### 🧪 2) Instance checks: <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; In previous version, there was no way to check if the component has an instance without creating a new instance. <br>

### 🧪 3) New singleton types: <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; - *ForceSingletonDontDestroy\<T>*<br>
